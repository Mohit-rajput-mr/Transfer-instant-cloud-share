# Voiceover with feeling (emotion 0.75-1.2 per line: higher = livelier; above ~1.4 the voice strains): Chatterbox (open model, run locally, CPU) cloned from the house voice (Kokoro bm_george,
# ref_george.wav), with an emotion level per line. Every take is checked by a speech recogniser (faster-whisper):
# the best-matching of up to 3 takes is kept, so no garbled line gets through.
